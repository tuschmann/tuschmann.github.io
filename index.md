## About me
I am a PhD Candidate at the [CDT in Mathematics of Random Systems](https://www.randomsystems-cdt.ac.uk) jointly run by the University of Oxford and Imperial College London, where I am supervised by [Dr. Eyal Neuman](https://eyaln13.wixsite.com/eyal-neuman) and [Prof. Johannes Muhle-Karbe](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~jmuhleka/). Previously, I completed my bachelor’s and master’s studies at the University of Münster, complemented by academic visits to the National University of Singapore and Princeton University.

My research interests lie in the areas of mathematical finance and stochastic processes, with a particular focus on optimal trading and dynamic stochastic games. I explore these subjects through functional and stochastic analysis, as well as game-theoretic methods.
